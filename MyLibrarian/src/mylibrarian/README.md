A simple Java application made to search for PDF files in a specified source directory, recursively in all subfolders, and then move them to a specified target directory.

The problem to solve was an old Zotero storage directory containing academic references for my Master's thesis project. Most of these folders contained PDF files containing research articles that I no longer have university access to. I wanted to centralise these in a user/library/articles directory. I could only think of procedural pseudocode in the style of Bash or C, so it seemed a great learning experience for object-oriented programming in Java.
